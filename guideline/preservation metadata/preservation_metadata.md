# Preservation Metadata
LOTAR requires that Information Packages include Preservation Description Information (PDI) which in turn comprises information related to:

*	Provenance
*	Reference
*	Fixity
*	Context

According to the CITS PREMIS: “When using preservation metadata together with the Common Specification for Information Packages (CSIP) (http://earkcsip.dilcis.eu), it is recommended that these are included in the Information Package in PREMIS format. Although this is not mandatory, all tools claiming to be able to validate CSIP compliant Information Packages must also be able to validate PREMIS metadata once it exists within the package. The two high-level requirements for the use of PREMIS in Common Specification IPs are that:
•	All preservation metadata is created according to official PREMIS guidelines;
•	All PREMIS metadata is referenced from the amdSec/digiprovMD element of the appropriate METS file.

It is recommended that users review the CITS PREMIS specification.

In addition, LOTAR states that “the producer shall integrate Validation properties into the PDI to ensure that the existence of Validation Properties for later automatic Validation processes.  As the Content Objects and Validation Properties related to Content Objects are held at Representation and as CITS 3D PM also requires the inclusion of Digital Signatures with each Representation then CITS 3D PM recommends the use of PREMIS at Representation level.
