# Descriptive Metadata
According to LOTAR: “The producer creates a set of Descriptive Information (DI), which includes archive metadata meeting the archives requirements (according to ISO 14721:2003 – OAIS).”

Neither CSIP or LOTAR prescribe specific schemas for Descriptive Information and so this is left to be determined by the user organisation. CSIP states that this should be according to a standardised schema and EAD is generally recommended. 

LOTAR also states: “ descriptive information should include a reference to data Verification report(s)” and as the data Verification process is conducted for each Representation, according to CSIP rules this Descriptive Metadata should be held at Representation level. In addition, although LOTAR asks only for a reference to the Verification report, it is good archival practice to also include the reports,  together with the criteria for data quality (Data Quality Rules). 

If a standardised metadata schema is used at Representation level then a suitable location for the reference will need to be found in the chosen schema (for example EAD), or provided in a schema extension and this location specified in the Submission Agreement. Extensions to standardised metadata schemas should also be included in the package Schemas folder.
