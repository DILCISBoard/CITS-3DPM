# CITS 3DPM Example AIP

The example AIP has been created manually using product model data from a test data set 'MARS Rover' which is available under an Apache license to freely share and produce derivative works from. The example package does not use the data set in its entirety; it has been abridged for clarity and fictitious metadata and documentation has been added (e.g. descriptive metadata, supporting documents). Not all files are fully populated (e.g. premis files) and for guidance on production of valid premis, users should refer to the Common Specification for Preservation Metadata in addition to the 3DPM specification.

Note that some data files have been replaced with dummy files with the correct filename and extension but zero data content. This is because the package otherwise exceeds GitHub limits.
