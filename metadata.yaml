abstract: |
        The CITS 3D PM is a Content Information Type Specification (CITS) for 3D Product Models as used in the engineering
        and aerospace industries. The specification is designed to be used for the transfer to archives as well as for
        records exchange between different 3D Product Model systems. The specification is supported by METS profiles for
        the Root and Representation METS files, an accompanying Guideline document and package examples. The 3D Product
        Model content specification limits its scope to the area of 3D digital product data such as computer aided design
        (CAD) or product data model (PDM) data where there is a current international standard for the long term archiving
        of this class of data in the LOTAR “Long Term Archiving and Retrieval of digital technical product information”,
        which is published as the EN and NAS 9300 series. However, although LOTAR extensively references and extends ISO
        14721 the “Open reference model for Archiving Information System”, (OAIS) it does not extend into areas detailed in
        the E-ARK common specification for information packages (CSIP). LOTAR references and builds on ISO 10303, the
        Standard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP) and so with this E-ARK 3D PM CITS we have the opportunity
        to add to an existing layered standards model.
