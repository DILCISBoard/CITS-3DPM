# Use Cases for Archiving of Product Model Data

Further detail of the use cases for long-term archiving of data in general and the rationales given in LOTAR specifically for Product Model data are given in the accompanying guideline. In summary, the use cases for archiving of Product Model data  are determined to be:

+ To enable the submission of 3D Product Model data from engineering departments in an organisation to a centralised or distributed archive, in a common format;
+ To store archival 3D Product Model data in a manner that will allow consolidation of archives intra-organisationially or with sources added through mergers or acquisitions;
+ To allow dissemination of Product Model archival data within the organisation or to external regulatory bodies preserving both the integrity of the data objects and the information packages.
